This document provides a reference for testing in the rfcdoc project.

1. Test Framework

   The rfcdoc project uses Mocha with TDD UI for testing. Tests are run using
   the @vscode/test-electron package which provides VSCode integration testing
   capabilities.

   1.1 Test Files Structure

       Tests are located in the src/test directory and follow the naming pattern
       *.test.js. They are organized in numbered files for logical grouping:
       
       - 1-basic-extension.test.js
       - 2-document-structure.test.js
       - 3-syntax-highlighting.test.js
       - etc.

   1.2 Test Organization

       Tests use Mocha's TDD style with suite() and test() functions:
       
       suite('Test Category', function() {
           test('Test Description', function() {
               // Test code here
           });
       });

2. Test Runner

   2.1 Main Runner

       The main test runner is implemented in src/test/index.js. It:
       - Configures Mocha with TDD UI
       - Discovers test files using glob pattern
       - Executes tests and reports results

   2.2 VSCode Integration

       The src/test/runTest.js file integrates with VSCode:
       - Sets up the extension development path
       - Configures the test environment
       - Runs tests in a VSCode instance

   2.3 Verbosity Control

       The src/test/run-with-verbosity.js script provides verbosity control:
       - Run with -v flag for detailed output
       - Without -v flag, only test results are shown
       - Controls VSCode log level and reporter configuration

3. VSCode Library

   The src/extension/vscode.lib.js provides utilities for testing:

   3.1 Document Operations

       - openDocument: Opens a document in the editor
       - getActiveEditor: Gets the active text editor
       - applyEdit: Applies an edit to a document

   3.2 Section Operations

       - getDocumentSections: Gets document sections using symbol provider
       - findSections: Finds sections in document text

   3.3 Test Utilities

       - createTestEnvironment: Creates a test environment with file utilities
       - waitForCondition: Waits for a condition to be true

4. Test Helpers

   The src/test/test-helpers.js provides additional test utilities:

   4.1 Environment Helpers

       - isVerbose: Flag indicating if tests are running in verbose mode
       - createTestEnv: Creates a test environment

   4.2 Notification Helpers

       - configureNotifications: Configures notifications for testing
       - enableTestNotification: Enables a specific notification
       - disableTestNotification: Disables a specific notification

    4.2 Tansform Test Utilities

    Since much of the code is about getting an input string and changing it to 
    an expected ouput, we have a structure that facilitates this. 

    How to use it: 

    1. Create a pair of input string and expected string.
        a. create a directory for it in tests/integration/fixtures/transform-examples 
        b. for every pair you want to check expected and actual text, create the expected text version (ending in .rfc and the expected output version ending in .txt) with the same names.
        c. both documents can have comments # whatever, for context, which will
        get stripped. we'll compare only the main body of code.
        d. call the helper with the path  to the pair you are checking and the function to transform, for example: 

         ## typescript
|        // Test a single case
|        await runTransformTest({
|          testDir: TRANSFORM_EXAMPLES_DIR,
|          testName: 'test-case-name',
|          transformFn: myTransformFunction
|        });
|        
|        // Test all cases in a directory
|        await runTransformTestsInDirectory(
|          TRANSFORM_EXAMPLES_DIR,
|          myTransformFunction
|        );

5. Running Tests

   5.1 Command Line

       Run tests from the command line:
       
       npm test              # Run all tests
       npm run test:verbose  # Run with verbose output

   5.2 Test Results

       Test results are displayed in the terminal:
       - In verbose mode: detailed output with test descriptions
       - In non-verbose mode: minimal output showing only pass/fail status
       - Test failures include stack traces and assertion details

   5.3 Debugging Tests

       Tests can be debugged using VSCode's debugging features:
       - Set breakpoints in test files
       - Use the "Extension Tests" launch configuration
       - View variables, call stack, and step through code
