# VSCode Grammar Implementation

The implementation of TextMate grammars for the txxt format has been consolidated into a simplified GrammarParser class.

For detailed documentation on the grammar parser, including:
- Basic usage
- Common operations
- Creating grammar files
- Troubleshooting
- API reference

Please refer to the comprehensive documentation in `grammar.txt`.

## Current Status

We have successfully:
1. Created a centralized GrammarParser class for managing TextMate grammars
2. Implemented proper WASM loading for Oniguruma
3. Added support for embedded languages
4. Set up comprehensive test infrastructure with simple.test.ts

All implementation details and usage examples are now documented in `grammar.txt`.
